                        <h2>Case Study</h2>
                        <p>Our research found that a structure fire is clearly associated with more reports of vacancies, repairs, and sales at that property. While these outcomes seem like clear results of fires, each is a different kind of story. Two particular row homes in Brewerytown illustrate the real-life example of what it means to have an “outcome”.</p>
                        <p>This first 2014 photo from depicts the two brick-red properties in good condition. These two houses are the same category of “row” building as 61% of properties in Philadelphia, and despite their older age, they’re popular due to their natural affordability.</p>

                        <h3>Vacancy</h3>
                        <p>In August 2017, the light red building on the left had a fire in a room seemingly in their upper floor, which left the front windows bare. The bottom window is left boarded.

                            In September 2018, the dark red building on the right had a larger fire that spread to both floors. 
                            
                            According to 311 complaints and inspection records from the Licencing and Inspection Department, both these properties were recorded as vacant. (Confirm)
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step" data-step="2">
                        <h4>In the year following…</h4>
                        <p>A year later, the google streetview camera happened to capture the clean-up of the right-side building. While most fire-stricken properties don’t receive vacancy complaints, they are six times more likely to experience them in the six months after a fire than similar properties that didn’t have a fire. The rate slows after six months, but vacancy reports are at least three times more likely for at least two years, and twice more likely until four years after the incident.</p> 

                            <p>Vacancy reports are also more likely leading up to the incident. This matches with research <a href="https://www.thv11.com/article/news/local/risk-of-vacant-building-fires/91-a4952807-fdc4-4961-ba94-f22c22d3c9cf" target="_blank">associating vacancy with fire risk.</a> </p>

                        <h4>Lingering Vacancy</h4>
                        <p>This one lasted seemingly for multiple years. Looking around, the property has 3 other adjacent vacancies.
                            It’s commonly understood that vacancy can spread on a block, or at least de-incentivize upkeep. 
                            Vacancies that were reported over a year after the fire happened were commonly in areas that had a high vacancy rate already.

                        <h4>How can vacancies be avoided?</h4>
                        <p>The biggest goal of residents after a fire is to get back into their homes, but it requires a lot of work.
                            Many renters do not have renter insurance that would allow quick recovery. This is either due to lack of information or the expense of coverage for those with lower incomes.
                            If a landlord lives out of state, households commonly have a harder time moving back in due to lack of attention from the landlords.

                        <h3>Sales</h3>
                        <p>In 2019, this Brewerytown home and its neighbor were still vacant. A year after this photo, was sold to a local developer.
                            Public records show that one was financed through Jumpstart LLC, a Philadelphia-based community development program with a mission to rehab blighted units and service small developers. 
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step" data-step="6">
                        <h4>Different Kinds of Investors</h4>
                        <p>This one was bought in mid 2019 by a different local developer that quickly implemented some fixes to make the property safe by L&I standards. This one had seemingly sustained more damage in a more severe 2018 fire.  
                            They then sold the property at a low price to Keystone Group, LLC, a national management/consulting firm. Keystone repaired the property and sold it in mid 2022 for 400% what it had paid for it.
                            Other vacant properties on the street have seen the same pattern, including investment from Philadelphia Housing Development Corporation to fix a different vacant house down the block.

                        <h4>Why Would Someone Sell?
                        </h4>
                        <p>These properties were both examples of blight, but the main reason someone would sell their property after a fire is if the insurance did not completely cover the cost of the home. 
                            Listings on Zillow that include the terms “fire damage” often court investors specifically, because those are normally the only ones looking to buy as-is homes.
                            Selling a home “as is” is usually a last-resort, but it was what these places seemingly had to do, possibly because they did not have adequate fire insurance. 
                            Lack of savings or income in some people’s homes puts them instantly in a tough situation, and they may not have resources or insurance to rebuild quickly enough. May be forced into a sale.

                        <h3>Repairs</h3>
                        <p>With finished repairs, both were then sold again in 2022. Both the local and national developer sold the houses for over $250k when they were bought at $60-80k, receiving over a 300% increase from their initial acquisition cost (zillow). Historically for this block, this is twice the normal sale price, but other older houses are also selling just a couple percentage points different, lately.
                            For our first example house, public records show it was last listed for rent at around $1,700 from an owner outside New York. (zillow).
